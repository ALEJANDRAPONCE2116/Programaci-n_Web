        Lohengrin is a Romantic opera in three acts composed and written by Richard Wagner, first performed in
        1850. The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the Parzival of
        Wolfram von Eschenbach and its sequel Lohengrin, itself inspired by the epic of Garin le Loherain. It is part of
        the Knight of the Swan legend.

        <br>
        The people of the Duchy of Brabant are divided by quarrels and political infighting; also, a devious hostile
        power left over from the region's pagan past is seeking to subvert the prevailing monotheistic government and to
        return the Duchy to pagan rule. A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting
        ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noble woman Elsa from a false
        accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa
        in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her
        faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.
