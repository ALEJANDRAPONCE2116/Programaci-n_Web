        Parsifal is an opera in three acts by German composer Richard Wagner. It is loosely based on Parzival
        by Wolfram von Eschenbach, a 13th-century epic poem of the Arthurian knight Parzival (Percival) and his quest
        for the Holy Grail (12th century).

        Wagner conceived the work in April 1857, but did not finish it until 25 years later. It was his last completed
        opera, and in composing it he took advantage of the particular acoustics of his Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

        The opera is set in the domain and in the castle of the guardians of the Grail, Monsalvat, where the landscape
        resembles the northern mountains of Gothic Spain. Afterwards in Klingsor's magic castle on the southern slope of
        the same mountains facing Moorish Spain.
        The costume of the Knights and Squires resembles that of the Templars: a white tunic and mantle; but instead of
        the red cross there is a dove flying upwards.
