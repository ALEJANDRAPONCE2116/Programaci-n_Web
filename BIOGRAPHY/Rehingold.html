        Das Rheingold is the first of the four music dramas that constitute Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen,
        (English: The
        Ring of the Nibelung). It was performed, as a single opera, at the National Theatre Munich on 22 September 1869,
        and received its first performance as part of the Ring cycle at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, on 13 August 1876.

        At the bottom of the Rhine, the three Rhinemaidens, Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Floßhilde, play together. Alberich,
        a Nibelung dwarf, appears from a deep chasm and tries to woo them. The maidens mock his advances and he grows
        angry – he chases them, but they elude, tease and humiliate him. A sudden ray of sunshine pierces the depths, to
        reveal the Rhinegold. The maidens rejoice in the gold's gleam. Alberich asks what it is. They explain that the
        gold, which their father has ordered them to guard, can be made into a magic ring which gives power to rule the
        world, if its bearer first renounces love. The maidens think they have nothing to fear from the lustful dwarf,
        but Alberich, embittered by their mockery, curses love, seizes the gold and returns to his chasm, leaving them
        screaming in dismay.
