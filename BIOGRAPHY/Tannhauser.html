        Tannhäuser is an 1845 opera in three acts, music and text by Richard Wagner, based on two German legends:
        Tannhäuser, the mythologized medieval German
        Minnesänger and poet, and the tale of the Wartburg Song Contest. The story centers on the struggle between
        sacred and profane love, and redemption through love, a theme running through much of Wagner's mature work.

        In Eisenach, Germany, in the early 13th century, the landgraves of the Thuringian Valley ruled the area of
        Germany around the Wartburg. They were great patrons of the arts, particularly music and poetry, holding
        contests between the minnesingers at the Wartburg. Across the valley towered the Venusberg, in whose interior,
        according to legend, dwelt Holda, the Goddess of Spring. In time, Holda became identified with Venus, the pagan
        Goddess of Love, whose grotto was the home of sirens and nymphs. It was said that the Goddess would lure the
        Wartburg minnesinger-knights to her lair where her beauty would captivate them. The minnesinger-knight Heinrich
        von Ofterdingen, known as Tannhäuser, left the court of the Landgrave of Thuringia a year ago after a
        disagreement with his fellow knights. Since then he has been held as a willing captive through his love for
        Venus, in her grotto in the Venusberg
