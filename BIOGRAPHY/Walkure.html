        Die Walküre is the second of the four music dramas that constitute Richard Wagner's Der
        Ring des Nibelungen, (English: The Ring of the Nibelung). It was performed, as a single opera, at the National
        Theatre Munich on 26 June 1870, and received its first performance as part of the Ring cycle at the Bayreuth
        Festspielhaus on 14 August 1876.

        <br>
        During the lengthy time that has passed since the gods entered Valhalla at the end of Das Rheingold, Fafner has
        used the Tarnhelm to assume the form of a dragon, and guards the gold and the ring in the depths of the forest.
        Wotan has visited Erda seeking wisdom, and by her has fathered a daughter, Brünnhilde; he has fathered eight
        other daughters, possibly also by Erda. These, with Brünnhilde, are the Valkyries, whose task is to recover
        heroes fallen in battle and bring them to Valhalla, where they will protect the fortress from Alberich's assault
        should the dwarf recover the ring. Wotan has also wandered the earth, and with a woman of the Völsung race has
        fathered the twins Siegmund and Sieglinde, who have grown up separately and unaware of each other. From the
        Völsungs Wotan hopes for a hero who, unencumbered by the gods' treaties, will obtain the ring from Fafner.
