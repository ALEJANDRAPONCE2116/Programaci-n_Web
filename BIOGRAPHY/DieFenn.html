            The Fairies is an opera in three acts with music by Richard Wagner and a libretto in German by the same
            composer,
            based on La donna serpente by Carlo Gozzi. Composed in 1833, but premiered on June 29, 1888 in Munich, The
            Fairies
            was Wagner's first completed opera, but it was never performed during the author's lifetime.

            While other fairies amuse themselves in a fairy garden, Zemina and Farzana discuss how their mistress Ada, a
            half-fairy, has renounced her immortality to spend her life with Arindal, the mortal whom she loves. The
            fairy-king has set a condition which Farzana believes that Arindal will not fulfil even with the help of the
            magician Groma. Nevertheless, they get the other fairies and spirits to pledge their help in separating Ada
            from the mortal.
