            <li>Born in Leipzig, Germany on May 22, 1813, Richard Wagner went on to become one of the world's most
                influential—and controversial—composers.</li>
            <li>His adoptive father Ludwig Geyer, an actor and painter, was his first instructor.</li>
            <li>As a young boy, Wagner attended school in Dresden, Germany. He did not show aptitude in music and, in
                fact, his teacher said he would "torture the piano in a most abominable fashion."</li>
            <li>When he was 11 years old, he wrote his first drama. By age 16, he was writing musical compositions.
                Young Wagner was so confident that some people considered him conceited.</li>
            <li>He also showed his interest in literature,especially classical, so he discovered in the opera his ideal,
                since he could dedicate himself to the two genres together.</li>
            <li>He composed his first operas for small-class theatres, Die Feen,in Magdeburg (1834)</li>
            <li>On November 24, 1836, he married actress Minna Planer.</li>
            <li>His accumulated debts while working in the theatres of Konigsberg, Dresden and Riga forced him to flee
                the country; Paris was his destination.</li>
            <li>Developed the idea of the"total workof art"(Gesamtkunstwerk),a synthesis of all the arts, in a series of
                essays between 1849 and 1852, and which took place in the first half of his tetralogy The Ring of the
                Nibelung.</li>
            <li>When the composer had retired to Mariafeld (near Zurich, May 1864) fleeing from his creditors, the
                cabinet secretary of Louis II appeared to indicate that the king, his most ardent admirer, would be
                flattered if he agreed to be his guest. . The numerous debts incurred were quickly paid</li>
            <li>Triebschen he received visits from Friedrich Nietzsche.</li>
            <li>Around this time he successively traveled to Germany to prepare the way for his Fesrspielhaus in
                Bayreuth and for the founding of the Wagner Society.</li>
            <li>King Louis II ordered the construction of a theater just to perform Wagner's plays</li>
            <li>Since then, Wagner's plays have been presented every year at the Bayreuth Theater.</li>
            <li>In 1882 he finished his last opera in Palermo, Parsifal. He suffered a first heart attack in Berlin
                (1881) and the second in Bayreuth, where Parsifal already premiered on July 26, 1882</li>
            <li>He moved to Venice to recover his already very deteriorated health.</li>
            <li>On February 13, 1883, he died in that city. On the 18th he was buried in Wahnfried's garden in Bayreuth,
                where his wife was later also buried.</li>
