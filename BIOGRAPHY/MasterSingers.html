        Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Master-Singers of Nuremberg) is a music drama (or opera) in three acts, written and composed by Richard Wagner. It is among the
        longest operas commonly performed, usually taking around four and a half hours. It was first performed at the
        National Theatre Munich, today the home of the Bavarian State Opera, in Munich, on 21 June 1868. The conductor
        at the premiere was Hans von Bülow.
