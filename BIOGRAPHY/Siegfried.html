        Siegfried is the third of the four music dramas
        that constitute Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), by Richard Wagner. It premiered at the
        Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 16 August 1876, as part of the first complete performance of The Ring cycle.

        A cave in rocks in the forest. An orchestral introduction includes references to leitmotifs including themes
        relating to the original hoard plundered by the Nibelung Alberich, and one in B-flat minor associated with the
        Nibelungs themselves. As the curtain rises, Alberich's brother, the dwarf Mime, is forging a sword. Mime is
        plotting to obtain the ring of power originally created by his brother Alberich. He has raised the human boy
        Siegfried as a foster child, to kill Fafner, who obtained the ring and other treasures in the opera Das
        Rheingold and has since transformed himself from a giant to a dragon. Mime needs a sword for Siegfried to use,
        but the youth has contemptuously broken every sword Mime has made. Siegfried returns from his wanderings in the
        forest with a wild bear in tow, and immediately breaks the new sword. After a whining speech by Mime about
        ingratitude, and how Mime has brought him up from a mewling infant ("Als zullendes Kind"), Siegfried senses why
        he keeps coming back to Mime although he despises him: he wants to know his parentage. Mime is forced to explain
        that he encountered Siegfried's mother, Sieglinde when she was in labor; she died giving birth to Siegfried. He
        shows Siegfried the broken pieces of the sword Nothung, which she had left in his custody. Siegfried orders him
        to reforge the sword; Mime, however, is unable to accomplish this. Siegfried departs, leaving Mime in despair
